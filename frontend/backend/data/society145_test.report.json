    "Further investigation into the specific legal title and any existing easements or covenants for 'society145' is required through the OnLand application [e001: http://www.ontario.ca/page/overview-land-registry, e003: http://www.ontario.ca/page/search-land-property-records].",
    "The exact boundaries and regulatory status of 'society145' relative to Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA) regulated areas (floodplains, wetlands, slopes) must be confirmed using the GRCA 'Map Your Property' tool, as regulations apply whether mapped or not [e004: https://www.grandriver.ca/planning-development/map-your-property/].",
    "The precise nature and scale of the proposed 'community amenity development' for 'society145' are not detailed in the provided evidence, which limits specific assessment of zoning compliance and exact permit needs. This will significantly influence the scope of required approvals.",
    "Direct consultation with City of Waterloo planning staff and the relevant consent-granting authority is highly recommended early in the process to understand specific local requirements, official plan conformity, and supporting material needed for any applications [e002: http://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/land-severances-consents].",
    "While Laurel Creek Conservation Area is a significant community amenity in Waterloo [e005: https://www.grandriver.ca/outdoor-recreation/conservation-areas/laurel-creek/], there is no evidence to suggest that 'society145' is located within its boundaries. If 'society145' is adjacent, potential impacts on the conservation area or its trails (Waterloo trails, Walter Bean Grand River Trail) would need to be addressed through site plan approval and environmental mitigation plans."
