## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This feasibility assessment for a land-use change proposal in Lisbon, Portugal, finds no automatic rejection criteria met based on the provided evidence. Crucially, none of the supplied snippets from official sources [all evidence marked `is_primary: false`] explicitly state an absolute prohibition as required for an automatic rejection. Therefore, the project is considered potentially feasible, subject to navigating several key approval processes.

**Key Constraints and Opportunities:**
The primary constraint lies in the necessity for comprehensive due diligence and multiple municipal and utility approvals. Environmental regulations pose a potential hurdle, particularly concerning flood risk [e001: sniambgeoogc.apambiente.pt] and general environmental compliance [e006: lisboa.pt]. Urban planning and building regulations in Lisbon are extensive, requiring a clear understanding of the Plano Diretor Municipal (PDM) and specific zoning for the site. The need for a "Pedido de Informação Prévia" [e002: informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt] highlights the structured approach required by the Municipality. The requirement for a "conservation license" [e003: informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt] suggests potential heritage or architectural considerations that could impact design and construction. Opportunities exist in the absence of hard blocks, indicating that a well-planned project, compliant with all regulations, has a pathway to approval.

**Required Approvals and Processes:**
1.  **Environmental Permits & Mitigation:** Detailed assessment for flood risk [e001: sniambgeoogc.apambiente.pt] and compliance with municipal environmental policies [e006: lisboa.pt].
2.  **Urban Planning Permits:** A "Pedido de Informação Prévia" [e002: informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt] is the essential first step. This will inform the need for potential zoning by-law amendments or minor variances, and subsequent site plan approvals [e004: informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt].
3.  **Heritage Permits & Conditions:** If applicable, a specific license for conservation works may be required [e003: informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt].
4.  **Site Plan & Building Permits:** Submission and approval of detailed "Projetos de Especialidades" (specialty technical projects) are mandatory [e012: informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt].
5.  **Utility Connection Agreements:** New water supply connections will require adherence to EPAL's standards, submission of project elements, and securing a "Certificado de Exploração" [e007, e008, e009, e010, e011: epal.pt].

**Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:**
The main risks include the discovery of explicit development prohibitions within environmental zones (e.g., floodways) during detailed site-specific environmental assessments, and potential non-compliance with existing zoning or heritage regulations. Mitigation strategies include initiating a formal "Pedido de Informação Prévia" [e002] immediately, engaging specialized consultants for urban planning, environmental, and heritage assessments, and early consultation with EPAL for utility connections.

**Timeline Estimates for Approval Processes:**
Precise timelines are project-specific and can vary significantly. However, typical municipal and utility approval processes in Lisbon, considering the need for multiple permits and potential amendments, can range from **12 to 24 months**, excluding construction time. Environmental assessments and complex zoning changes can extend this.

**Cost Implications:**
While specific costs are not available from the evidence, the project will incur various fees including: municipal application fees (e.g., for prior information, licenses, permits), consultant fees (planning, architectural, engineering, environmental, legal), and potential costs for utility infrastructure upgrades or connections.

**Recommendations:**
Proceed with detailed site-specific investigations, starting with the formal "Pedido de Informação Prévia" to ascertain exact planning parameters and potential constraints. Concurrently, commission an environmental assessment focused on flood risk and engage utility providers for a preliminary capacity assessment.
