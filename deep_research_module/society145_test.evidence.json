This occurs by way of an approval known as a consent. A consent is required if you want to sell, mortgage, charge or enter into any agreement for more than 21 years for a portion of your land. If the land is split already, by a public road or railway for example, consent is not needed.\n\nMost municipalities with an approved official plan have specific policies and requirements for land severances. In addition to the division of land, rights-of-way, easements and any change to your existing property boundaries also require consents.\n\nIf several severances are intended for the same area, a plan of subdivision may be more appropriate. It is up to the consent-granting authority in your area to decide whether a consent is the best approach or if a plan of subdivision is necessary for the proper and orderly development of your community. (See[section 4](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/subdivisions), Subdivisions)\n\nWhy you need approval to sever land\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe indiscriminate division of land without planning review and approval can have a long-term, negative impact on your community. For example, it could result in over-extension of municipal services, such as snow plowing, school busing and garbage collection. Or it might result in damage to the natural environment if lots are too small to accommodate adequate sewage disposal systems.\n\nApproval is required to ensure that:\n\n*   land severances are considered within an established planning framework\n*   new parcels of land and new land uses do not conflict with the overall future planning goals and policies of your community\n*   consideration is given to the effects of the division of land on the site, on the neighbours and on the community as a whole\n\nOnce a severance has been approved, the new land parcels may be sold or resold without further approval. The only exceptions are if the consent-granting authority has specified that this should not occur without further approval (for example, for an approval of a severance that is adding land to a neighbouring lot (often called a lot addition)).\n\nLand severance approvals\n------------------------\n\nThe approval of severances can rest with one of a number of different governing bodies. Depending on the area, an upper-tier or single-tier municipal council may grant consents. An upper-tier municipality may then delegate the function to a committee of council or an appointed officer. It may also delegate the authority to a lower-tier municipality, a land division committee or to a municipal planning authority. A single or lower-tier municipality may also delegate its approval functions to a committee of council, an appointed officer or to a committee of adjustment. In Northern Ontario, where planning approval has not been assigned or delegated to a municipality or planning board, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing grants consents (See[section 7](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/northern-ontario), Northern Ontario).\n\nTo determine the consent-granting authority in your area, contact your municipal clerk, the secretary-treasurer of the planning board or your nearest[Municipal Services Office](https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-your-municipal-services-office).\n\nThe process for a severance application\n---------------------------------------\n\nBefore you apply for a land severance, you should consult with municipal staff and/or the consent-granting authority in your area. They will be able to tell you how to apply, what supporting material you must submit (for example, sketches, plans), if there are any special land severance requirements set out in the official plan and what other permits and approvals (for example, a septic system permit) may be required.\n\nThe consent-granting authority may not accept an application that fails to provide the information or material prescribed by minister\u2019s regulation and, in some cases, the information set out in the official plan. If a consent-granting authority confirms that an application is incomplete, an applicant who disagrees may make a motion to the[Ontario Land Tribunal](https://olt.gov.on.ca/about-olt/)(OLT) or, if established by the municipality, a local appeal body, to decide the matter.\n\nThe OLT(or local appeal body\u2019s) decision is final. However, in such situations, you are strongly encouraged to work out a mutually-acceptable solution with the consent-granting authority before making a motion to the OLT or local appeal body.\n\nWhen applying for a land severance, you may be charged a fee for processing the application. To determine the processing fee in your area, contact the appropriate consent-granting authority.\n\nAs an applicant, you are usually required to fill out a consent application form provided by the consent-granting authority.\n\nA typical application form contains both the information which is prescribed by minister\u2019s regulation as well as additional information which the consent-granting authority may require. The more information you provide, the less likely delays will occur in the review process.\n\nIf you do not provide all the information prescribed by minister\u2019s regulation and in some cases, information or material set out in the official plan, the consent-granting authority may refuse to accept or to further consider your application. The 90-day timeframe for making a decision does not begin until all the required information is received. You are encouraged to contact the appropriate consent-granting authority if you need help in assessing what information is required.\n\nThe consent-granting authority must give notice of application before a decision is made. Notice of application is given at least 14 days in advance of a decision by the consent-granting authority, either through local newspapers or by mail and posted notice. Any person or public body may submit his or her views to the consent-granting authority.\n\nThe consent-granting authority may consult with agencies, boards, authorities or commissions before making a decision.\n\nWhen the consent-granting authority has decided on your application, it is required to send a notice of decision to any person or public body requesting to be notified within 15 days of the decision being made. When a notice of decision is given, a 20-day appeal period follows.\n\nHow a severance application is evaluated\n----------------------------------------\n\nIn considering each application for land severance, the consent-granting authority evaluates the merits of each proposal against criteria such as:\n\n*   conformity with the[official plan](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/official-plans)and compatibility with neighbouring uses of land\n*   suitability of the land for the proposed purpose, including the size and shape of the lot(s) being created\n*   adequacy of vehicular access, water supply, sewage disposal\n*   the need to ensure protection from potential flooding\n\nIn considering a consent application, the consent-granting authority\u2019s decision shall be consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) and conform/not conflict with any applicable provincial plan. This means that a council must ensure that provincial policies and plans are applied as an essential part of the land use planning decision-making process.\n\nThe PPS contains policy directions on matters of[provincial interest](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90p13#BK5)related to land use planning and development. It is expected that the consent-granting authority will implement the PPS in the context of other planning objectives and local circumstances. (See[section 1](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/planning-act), The Planning Act and the[Provincial Policy Statement,2020](https://www.ontario.ca/pps)).\n\nProvincial plans contain specific land use planning policies that address issues facing specific geographic areas in Ontario (for example, A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, Greenbelt Plan).\n\nConditions of severance approval\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen a proposed severance is eligible for approval, the consent-granting authority can give provisional consent (sometimes called consent-in-principle). This approval typically has certain conditions attached to it including requirements for road widenings,[parkland dedication](https://www.ontario.ca/page/municipal-development-and-community-benefits-charges-and-parklands#section-3), or a rezoning (or[minor variance](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/zoning-bylaws#section-9)) to adjust the permitted lot dimensions. In addition, the property owner may be required to enter into an agreement with the municipality to provide future services or facilities. Severance conditions must be met within two years.\n\nWhen all the conditions have been met by the applicant, a certificate is issued by the authority, and the severance goes into effect after it has been registered in the land registry office.\n\nIf the transaction originally applied for\u2013 sale of property, for example\u2013 is not carried out within two years of the date of the certificate, the severance is considered lapsed. An earlier lapsing date can be specified by the consent-granting authority at the time of the severance decision.\n\nCertificate for retained land\n-----------------------------\n\nA consent-granting authority may also issue a certificate for the retained land (the other part of the parcel approved through the land division process) resulting from certain consents. This certificate shows that the retained land has \u201cconsent\u201d status.\n\nIf you would like to request a certificate for retained land, you must specify this in your consent application and provide a statement from a lawyer as part of your application. This statement must confirm that the land subject to the consent and the land to be retained, together, make up a complete parcel of land.\n\nBefore you apply, you should consult with municipal staff and/or the consent-granting authority in your area. They will be able to tell you how to request a certificate for retained land and what information will need to be included as part of your application.\n\nCertificate of cancellation\n---------------------------\n\nIn some situations, the original consent granted for a parcel of land may no longer be wanted or needed. This could occur, for example, where a parcel created by consent may need to be widened to accommodate a driveway. In these cases, the original consent may need to be cancelled.\n\nOwners can apply to the consent-granting authority for a certificate of cancellation for a parcel that was previously severed with a consent. It may even be the case that a consent-granting authority may require the owner to apply as a condition of approval. Once a certificate of cancellation is issued, the parcel would be treated as though the previous consent had not been given. This could mean that the parcel would merge with neighbouring lands that are owned by the same person.\n\nBefore you apply, you should consult with municipal staff and/or the consent-granting authority in your area. They will be able to tell you how to apply for a certificate of cancellation and any other information you may need.\n\nGet involved\n------------\n\nIf you are concerned about a severance application that may affect you, you should:\n\n*   find out as much as possible about the application\n*   discuss your concerns with the consent-granting authority\n*   write to the consent-granting authority\n\nIf you have any concerns, make sure that you let council know about them early in the process. The consent-granting authority will then have time to consider the feedback you provided and may make changes before the land severance is approved.\n\nAppeal rights\n-------------\n\nAppeals to the OLT, or a local appeal body if established by the municipality, can be made in three different ways:\n\n1.   key participants (for example, applicants, the Province, public bodies, including First Nations, and utility providers) may appeal a consent-granting authority\u2019s decision and any condition within 20 days of the notice of decision\n2.   the applicant may appeal if no decision is made by the consent-granting authority within 90 days from the date of receipt of the application containing the prescribed information\n3.   key participants (for example, applicants, the Province, public bodies, including First Nations, and utility providers)may appeal any changed conditions imposed by the consent-granting authority within 20 days after the notice of changed conditions has been given\n\nAppeals must be filed with the consent-granting authority, accompanied by reasons for the appeal and the fee required by the OLT or local appeal body.\n\nThe powers of the Ontario Land Tribunal or a local appeal body if one is established\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen a decision is appealed, the OLT or local appeal body may hold a hearing where you may have the chance to present your case. They can make any decision that the consent-granting authority could have made on the application.\n\nThe OLT or local appeal body also has the power to dismiss an appeal without holding a hearing. For more information, see[section 6](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/local-planning-appeal-tribunal), Ontario Land Tribunal.\n\nAppealing a planning decision is a serious matter. It can take time, effort and in some cases, money, for everyone involved.\n\nThe OLT or local appeal body must have regard to the local decision and make a decision based on the facts presented at a hearing.\n\nOther approvals that may be required\n------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to the planning approvals and building permit which are needed for a building project, there are other permits and approvals that may be required for specific circumstances. For example, a septic system permit is required for a new septic system. In cottage areas, a permit may be required from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry before you can do any construction in the water (for example, a dock or boathouse with a solid foundation).Should your property be designated under the Ontario Heritage Act, located in a heritage conservation district or subject to a heritage conservation easement (a legal agreement to protect heritage elements that applies to anyone who owns the land) you may require a separate heritage approval from the municipality or the Ontario Heritage Trust.\n\nValidation process\n------------------\n\nSection 57 of the Planning Act provides for the validation (or legalization) of title for lands where there was a failure in the past to follow the subdivision control requirements of the Act (for example, through fraudulent activity, error or naivety of persons selling/buying).\n\nDepending on where you live in the province, validations can be issued by either:\n\n*   a municipality\n*   a planning board\n*   the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\n\nTo find the validation authority in your area, contact your municipal clerk, the secretary-treasurer of the planning board or your nearest[Municipal Services Office](https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-your-municipal-services-office).\n\nA validation can be used in place of obtaining a consent to the contravening transfer(transfer that was made in breach of the Planning Act requirements)in certain situations, for example, where the landowners at the time of the contravention are not available to sign the new transfer documents.\n\nThe validation allows the validation authority to consider each situation on its merits and decide whether a request to validate title should be supported. The validation authority may, as a condition to issuing the validation, impose conditions as it considers appropriate.\n\nThe considerations that need to be applied to each request to validate title to a piece of land are the same as the considerations that need to be given to a consent application. The validation authority needs to:\n\n*   have regard to provincial interests and the Planning Act\u2019s land division criteria\n*   ensure the validation is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement and conforms, or does not conflict, with provincial plans\n*   ensure the validation conforms with all applicable official plans\n*   ensure the validation complies with any applicable zoning bylaw or zoning order\n\nSummary of the land severance process\n-------------------------------------\n\n1.   before an application is submitted, the applicant should consult with municipal staff or the consent-granting authority\n2.   following the pre-consultation, a complete application is submitted to the consent-granting authority\n3.   the consent-granting authority gives notice of the application and a public meeting may be held\n4.   the consent-granting authority will make its decision to give either provisional consent or to refuse the application\n5.   notice of decision is sent to the applicant and those requesting notification\n6.   key participants may appeal to the OLT or local appeal body if one is established\n7.   if an appeal is made, the OLT may dismiss the appeal without holding a hearing or will hold a hearing and make a decision\n8.   if no appeal is made, when the conditions of provisional consent are satisfied, a certificate is issued and the lot can be transferred",

In Northern Ontario, where planning approval has not been assigned or delegated to a municipality or planning board, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing grants consents (See[section 7](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/northern-ontario), Northern Ontario).\n\nTo determine the consent-granting authority in your area, contact your municipal clerk, the secretary-treasurer of the planning board or your nearest[Municipal Services Office](https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-your-municipal-services-office).\n\nThe process for a severance application\n---------------------------------------\n\nBefore you apply for a land severance, you should consult with municipal staff and/or the consent-granting authority in your area. They will be able to tell you how to apply, what supporting material you must submit (for example, sketches, plans), if there are any special land severance requirements set out in the official plan and what other permits and approvals (for example, a septic system permit) may be required.\n\nThe consent-granting authority may not accept an application that fails to provide the information or material prescribed by minister\u2019s regulation and, in some cases, the information set out in the official plan. If a consent-granting authority confirms that an application is incomplete, an applicant who disagrees may make a motion to the[Ontario Land Tribunal](https://olt.gov.on.ca/about-olt/)(OLT) or, if established by the municipality, a local appeal body, to decide the matter.\n\nThe OLT(or local appeal body\u2019s) decision is final. However, in such situations, you are strongly encouraged to work out a mutually-acceptable solution with the consent-granting authority before making a motion to the OLT or local appeal body.\n\nWhen applying for a land severance, you may be charged a fee for processing the application. To determine the processing fee in your area, contact the appropriate consent-granting authority.\n\nAs an applicant, you are usually required to fill out a consent application form provided by the consent-granting authority.\n\nA typical application form contains both the information which is prescribed by minister\u2019s regulation as well as additional information which the consent-granting authority may require. The more information you provide, the less likely delays will occur in the review process.\n\nIf you do not provide all the information prescribed by minister\u2019s regulation and in some cases, information or material set out in the official plan, the consent-granting authority may refuse to accept or to further consider your application. The 90-day timeframe for making a decision does not begin until all the required information is received. You are encouraged to contact the appropriate consent-granting authority if you need help in assessing what information is required.\n\nThe consent-granting authority must give notice of application before a decision is made. Notice of application is given at least 14 days in advance of a decision by the consent-granting authority, either through local newspapers or by mail and posted notice. Any person or public body may submit his or her views to the consent-granting authority.\n\nThe consent-granting authority may consult with agencies, boards, authorities or commissions before making a decision.\n\nWhen the consent-granting authority has decided on your application, it is required to send a notice of decision to any person or public body requesting to be notified within 15 days of the decision being made. When a notice of decision is given, a 20-day appeal period follows.\n\nHow a severance application is evaluated\n----------------------------------------\n\nIn considering each application for land severance, the consent-granting authority evaluates the merits of each proposal against criteria such as:\n\n*   conformity with the[official plan](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/official-plans)and compatibility with neighbouring uses of land\n*   suitability of the land for the proposed purpose, including the size and shape of the lot(s) being created\n*   adequacy of vehicular access, water supply, sewage disposal\n*   the need to ensure protection from potential flooding\n\nIn considering a consent application, the consent-granting authority\u2019s decision shall be consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) and conform/not conflict with any applicable provincial plan. This means that a council must ensure that provincial policies and plans are applied as an essential part of the land use planning decision-making process.\n\nThe PPS contains policy directions on matters of[provincial interest](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90p13#BK5)related to land use planning and development. It is expected that the consent-granting authority will implement the PPS in the context of other planning objectives and local circumstances. (See[section 1](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/planning-act), The Planning Act and the[Provincial Policy Statement,2020](https://www.ontario.ca/pps)).\n\nProvincial plans contain specific land use planning policies that address issues facing specific geographic areas in Ontario (for example, A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, Greenbelt Plan).\n\nConditions of severance approval\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen a proposed severance is eligible for approval, the consent-granting authority can give provisional consent (sometimes called consent-in-principle). This approval typically has certain conditions attached to it including requirements for road widenings,[parkland dedication](https://www.ontario.ca/page/municipal-development-and-community-benefits-charges-and-parklands#section-3), or a rezoning (or[minor variance](https://www.ontario.ca/document/citizens-guide-land-use-planning/zoning-bylaws#section-9)) to adjust the permitted lot dimensions. In addition, the property owner may be required to enter into an agreement with the municipality to provide future services or facilities. Severance conditions must be met within two years.\n\nWhen all the conditions have been met by the applicant, a certificate is issued by the authority, and the severance goes into effect after it has been registered in the land registry office.\n\nIf the transaction originally applied for\u2013 sale of property, for example\u2013 is not carried out within two years of the date of the certificate, the severance is considered lapsed. An earlier lapsing date can be specified by the consent-granting authority at the time of the severance decision.\n\nCertificate for retained land\n-----------------------------\n\nA consent-granting authority may also issue a certificate for the retained land (the other part of the parcel approved through the land division process) resulting from certain conse"

Our Map Your Property tool, which you can access via the municipality links below, will help you learn if all, or part, of your property is regulated by the GRCA.\n\nIn some cases, not all of the areas described above may be mapped. It is important to know that the Regulation still applies,whether these areas are mapped or not. If you are unsure whether your property is regulated, contact a[Regulations Officer](https://www.grandriver.ca/planning-development/contact-a-member-of-our-team/ \"Contact a planner\")or email the[Permits Inbox](mailto:permits@grandriver.ca \"Email the Permits\u00a0Inbox\").\n\nIf the map shows that your property is within an area regulated by the GRCA and you want to do any construction work or development activities on it, you will need a GRCA permit. This is in addition to a building permit or other approvals from your municipality and other agencies.\n\nGo to our[**Permits**](https://www.grandriver.ca/planning-development/permits/ \"Permits\")page for more information on how to apply for a permit.\n\nYou can use the Map Your Property tool to prepare a map to attach to your permit application. That will help the GRCA Resource Planner know exactly where your property is.\n\nMap Your Property tool\n----------------------\n\n### How to find your property\n\n1.

and[the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-environment-conservation-parks)(MECP) to improve the operation of wastewater treatment plants through a program called the Watershed-wide Wastewater Optimization Program (WWOP).The WWOP is an important initiative to support the[GRCA strategic plan](https://www.grandriver.ca/who-we-are/governance/grca-strategic-plan/ \"View our GRCA Strategic Plan page\")priority of improving river health. By working together, we have demonstrated a reduction in the amount of phosphorus and ammonia discharged in the Grand River watershed.\n\n### What is Optimization?\n\nOptimization is a continuous improvement process that uses the full potential of people and infrastructure. This means using the existing equipment at the wastewater treatment plant to its maximum capacity before building expensive new tanks and treatment processes.\n\n### What are the benefits of Optimization?\n\nThe benefits will vary from plant to plant but optimizing the operation of a wastewater treatment plant has resulted in:\n\n*   Identifying potential cost savings and/or deferring capital investment\n*   Gaining a deeper understanding of the wastewater treatment plant\n*   Reducing the number of bypasses\n*   Producing better effluent quality\n\n### What are the Goals of the WWOP?\n\nThe overall goal of the program is to improve the quality of the Grand River by reducing**phosphorus**and**ammonia**from wastewater treatment plants. We have set out voluntary targets for these parameters. We work with municipal owners and operators to achieve these targets through the following activities:\n\n*   Hosting training and workshops\n*   Conducting on-site studies\n*   Providing technical support\n*   Preparing an annual report on wastewater treatment plant performance\n*   Hosting an annual workshop with municipal and MECP partners\n*   Delivering a recognition program to celebrate wastewater treatment plants that participate in the WWOP and achieve the voluntary targets\n\nAdditional resources can be found below.\n\n[Annual Reports \u2013 Watershed Overview of WWTP Performance](https://www.grandriver.ca/our-watershed/water/wastewater/wastewater-optimization/#collapse_dc6d2b0d-769c-42b1-a59b-d83a8a367370_1)\n\n*   [2017 Annual Report Executive Summary (2MB PDF)](https://www.grandriver.ca/media/ndqfzjat/2017-wwop-executive-summary.pdf \"Executive Summary of 2017 Watershed Overview of Wastewater Treatment Performance\")\n*   [2018 Annual Report Executive Summary (2MB PDF)](https://www.grandriver.ca/media/00dfyaix/2018-wwop-executive-summary.pdf \"Open new window to view 2018\u00a0Annual Report Executive Summary\u00a0(0.2MB PDF)\")\n*   [2019 Annual Report Executive Summary (2MB PDF)](https://www.grandriver.ca/media/4pfptdte/2019-wwop-executive-summary.pdf \"Open new window to view 2019 Annual Report Executive Summary\u00a0(0.2MB\u00a0PDF)\")\n*   [2020 Annual Report Executive Summary (2MB PDF)](https://www.grandriver.ca/media/gkgghjbs/2020-wwop-executive-summary.pdf \"Open new window to view 2020 Annual Report Executive Summary (0.2MB PDF)\")\n*   [2021 Annual Report (1.5MB PDF)](https://www.grandriver.ca/media/pq3fn32p/2021-wwtp-summary-report-aoda_st.pdf \"Open new window to view 2021 Annual Report (1.5MB PDF)\")\n*   [2022 WWTP Annual Summary Report (1.8MB PDF)](https://www.grandriver.ca/media/45rnsddi/2022-wwtp-summary-report.pdf \"2022 WWTP Summary Report\")\n*   [2023 WWTP Annual Summary Report (1.4MB PDF)](https://www.grandriver.ca/media/rjzjqnfr/2023-wwtp-summary-report.pdf \"2023 WWTP Summary Report\")\n\nFull reports are available from 2012 to 2020.

and[the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-environment-conservation-parks)(MECP) to improve the operation of wastewater treatment plants through a program called the Watershed-wide Wastewater Optimization Program (WWOP).The WWOP is an important initiative to support the[GRCA strategic plan](https://www.grandriver.ca/who-we-are/governance/grca-strategic-plan/ \"View our GRCA Strategic Plan page\")priority of improving river health. By working together, we have demonstrated a reduction in the amount of phosphorus and ammonia discharged in the Grand River watershed.\n\n### What is Optimization?\n\nOptimization is a continuous improvement process that uses the full potential of people and infrastructure. This means using the existing equipment at the wastewater treatment plant to its maximum capacity before building expensive new tanks and treatment processes.\n\n### What are the benefits of Optimization?\n\nThe benefits will vary from plant to plant but optimizing the operation of a wastewater treatment plant has resulted in:\n\n*   Identifying potential cost savings and/or deferring capital investment\n*   Gaining a deeper understanding of the wastewater treatment plant\n*   Reducing the number of bypasses\n*   Producing better effluent quality\n\n### What are the Goals of the WWOP?\n\nThe overall goal of the program is to improve the quality of the Grand River by reducing**phosphorus**and**ammonia**from wastewater treatment plants. We have set out voluntary targets for these parameters. We work with municipal owners and operators to achieve these targets through the following activities:\n\n*   Hosting training and workshops\n*   Conducting on-site studies\n*   Providing tech"

The results of the search will be printed on a computer generated Sheriff\u2019s certificate.

An example for the form to be used for this affidavit is contained in the Land Titles Procedural Guide and requires inclusion of information such as the plaintiff, writ number, the amount of the writ and a statement that the judgement debtor is not one and the same person.It has been the practice in some land registry offices for the staff to check the details of the writ with the details set out in the affidavit.

The _Homeowner Protection Act,2024,_ would ban the registration of Notices of Security Interest (NOSIs) for consumer goods on the Land Registry and deem NOSIs for consumer goods currently registered on title to be expired. It would also provide additional protections for new homebuyers by establishing a 10-day cooling-off period for buyers of new freehold homes.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark piece of legislation \u2013 the first of its kind in Canada \u2013to protect consumers from fraud and bad actors,\u201d said Todd McCarthy, Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery. \u201cBy banning the registration of consumer Notices of Security Interest on land titles, we're putting an end to the exploitation that has targeted our elderly and most vulnerable residents. Moreover, we\u2019re giving Ontarians the crucial information and time they need to confidently make one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives through our enhanced protections for new homebuyers.\u201d\n\nNotices of Security Interest are registrations that may be made on the land registry system by a business when it rents, finances or leases goods such as a water heater or furnace installed on a property. While NOSI registrations are intended to help a business protect their interest in those goods, investigations have revealed bad actors use NOSIs to extort exorbitant payments from consumers, particularly seniors. These scams can sometimes involve leveraging the NOSI, or multiple NOSIs, to secure high-interest mortgages on the property, which can ultimately lead to the homeowner losing their property.\n\nThe proposed changes do not eliminate a business\u2019 security interest in the fixture or invalidate their contract with the consumer. If the consumer defaults on payment, the business may still be able to repossess the fixture and seek repayment through other means, such as through the courts.\n\nThe proposed legislation would further strengthen consumer protections for homeowners and buyers by establishing a 10-day cooling-off period for purchases of new freehold homes, allowing buyers to cancel agreements without penalties. This provides buyers with time to fully understand their commitments and back out if they choose.\n\nThe province also intends to further strengthen consumer protections for condominium communities and people buying new freehold homes by:\n\n*   Ensuring public disclosure of builder cancellations of purchase agreements for new freehold homes to promote transparency, protecting consumers from unreliable builders.\n*   Consulting on proposals to crack down on illegal home building and selling.\n*   Expanding the Condominium Authority Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to cover a broader range of disputes, giving condo owners more accessible and efficient resolution options and improving condo management. Additionally, the province will consult with stakeholders to strengthen protections for condo owners and purchasers to improve how condos are run.\n\nThe province intends to consult in the coming months on changes to support the implementation of the cooling-off period for purchases of new freehold homes, improve access to information and transparency for buyers of new freehold homes, and better support condo communities.\n\nAs part of the legislation, the Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism is proposing amendments to the [_Ontario Heritage Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90o18), to help ease administrative pressures related to the conservation of legacy listed heritage properties. This would help ensure municipalities are prioritizing the review of properties most important to their communities, by extending the timeline for them to review listed properties by an additional two years to January 1,2027. These proposed changes will help with the conservation of heritage properties while supporting housing construction and future growth.\n\n* * *\n\nQuick Facts\n-----------\n\n*   In fall 2023, the Ministry of Public and Business Service Delivery held extensive consultations on specific approaches to address the misuse of NOSIs. The ministry received feedback from businesses, legal organizations, law enforcement, other regulators, and consumer advocates, as well as many consumers negatively affected by NOSIs.\n*   Based on all the information received through the consultation process, it has become apparent that the harms caused by the misuse of consumer NOSIs on the [Land Registry](https://www.ontario.ca/page/overview-land-registry) far outweigh the benefits provided by their legitimate use.\n*   Ontario passed the [_Better for Consumers, Better for Businesses Act, 2023_](https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1003687/ontario-strengthening-protections-for-consumers),in December 2023.

    "snippet": "CHAPTER 2 VISION, PRINCIPLES AND BASIS OF THE PLAN\n2.1 CITY OF WATERLOO COMMUNITY VISION STATEMENT\nThis Official Plan is based on achieving the following community vision statement:\nIn 2031, the City of Waterloo has enhanced its friendly feel, welcoming and\naccommodating a diversity of people. Waterloo is a caring community where people\nsupport each other; a green City with healthy green spaces, land, water and clean\nair; an economic leader with a strong diverse economy; a community of vibrant\nneighbourhoods and a range of housing options; a learning community with strong\nties to its schools, universities and college; an exciting City with abundant recreation,\nleisure, arts and cultural opportunities; and a City that is accessible to all. Waterloo\nis a better place to live, work, learn, shop and play than ever.\n2.2 PRINCIPLES OF THE PLAN\nThe City will strive to achieve a healthy and sustainable community by adopting the\nfollowing four principles for growth that aim to provide for a balance of social, cultural,\nenvironmental, and economic interests. The principles reflect the long range direction for\nthe City, are broad in a nature and are the foundation for the objectives and policies found\nin subsequent chapters of this Plan.\n(1) Diversity and Adaptability \u2013 Natural, social and economic systems are strongest\nwhen they incorporate diversity. This Plan emphasizes diversity within the physical\nform of the City, the natural systems, the social and cultural systems, and the local\neconomy. Within the principle of diversity is the idea of adaptability. A system that\nhas diversity is more adaptable to change than a system that lacks diversity.\nAdaptability also incorporates the idea of future orientation. The Plan will strive to\nbalance the needs of today\u2019s population with the needs of future generations.\n(2) Accessibility and Equity \u2013 All members of the community have access to the\ngoods and services they require in their daily lives. This does not necessarily mean\nthat all neighbourhoods must be the same or include the same numbers of\namenities. Rather, it means that the overall organization of the City and the\ntransportation system shall allow all people equitable access to goods and\nservices.\n(3) Connectivity \u2013 Connectivity has two elements: physical and non- physical.\nPhysical connectivity refers to the linking of space, both built spaces and natural\n8\n\nspaces. Connectivity to places outside the City is also important. Connectivity\nshould not favour efficiency over effectiveness and equity.\nThe non-physical element of connectivity refers to connecting people and\ninformation. The Plan is based on the principle that communities thrive and prosper\nwhen people can communicate, interact, exchange ideas, and share in community\ndecision making. This Official Plan will be used as a tool to plan for, encourage,\nand in some cases provide opportunities that improves communication and\ninteraction.\n(4) Health and Vitality \u2013 The principle of health is based on the idea that in order to\nsucceed, a community must have the basic elements of physical safety and\nhealthy air, water, and land. The principle of vitality means a city that is socially\nand culturally vibrant and diversity is desired and supported. Community vitality is\nmost often expressed in the public spaces of the city including neighbourhoods,\nstreets, squares, parks, community centres and other spaces. The Plan shall be\nbased on the principle that public space is necessary to the establishment of\ncommunity. To reflect the principles of health and vitality, our public spaces need\nto be comfortable, safe, beautiful, accessible, suitable, and convey a sense of\nidentity. Public spaces provide the forum for public interaction, which is the key\ningredient to the formation of a strong community.\n2.3 BASIS OF THE PLAN\nThe development of this Plan has been based on an understanding of the local and\nbroader context as well as anticipated trends and factors that may have an influence on\ngrowth and change in Waterloo. The purpose of this Section is to provide an overview of\ntrends and factors that are considered to have a significant influence on the land use\npolicies and designations of this Plan. The overview relates to, and should be read in\nconjunction with the remaining chapters of this Plan.\nGrowth and City Form\n(1) There is a limited supply of vacant land for future urban growth. To ensure that\npopulation and economic growth can be accommodated; land within the City must\nbe used more efficiently. A significant proportion of the City\u2019s population and\nemployment growth is expected to be accommodated through intensification within\nthe existing Built-up Area, resulting in changes to height and density in existing\nareas. Focal points for intensification include the Uptown Waterloo Urban Growth\nCentre, Major Transit Station Areas and other designated Nodes and Corridors.\n9\n\nFurther, the City will rely on Designated Greenfield Areas to accommodate a\nsignificant portion of population and employment growth. Using land more\nintensively within Designated Greenfield Areas may result in new communities\nthat have higher densities than other suburban areas of the City.\n(2) The Uptown Waterloo Urban Growth Centre is a focal point within the City, and\nWaterloo\u2019s Primary Node. The Uptown Waterloo Urban Growth Centre will be\nplanned to permit cultural facilities, recreational uses, institutional uses, public\nopen spaces, residential, employment and commercial uses that collectively\ncreate a vibrant, human-scaled Uptown Waterloo Urban Growth Centre. This form\nof growth will support transit and active transportation modes, reduce the need for\nautomobile travel and commuting times to and from the Uptown Waterloo Urban\nGrowth Centre, and support a pedestrian-oriented streetscape. In preparing this\nOfficial Plan, regard has been had to \u201cUptown Vision 2025\u201d.\n(3) The Region is planning to implement rapid transit. This Plan includes policies that\nsupport rapid transit and recognize it as being consistent with the City\u2019s policies\nfor intensification within designated Nodes and Corridors. Major Transit Station\nAreas will be planned to support existing and planned transit service levels and will\naccommodate high density, mixed-use, transit-supportive development, where\nappropriate.\n(4) Waterloo will be planned as a complete community that provides opportunities for\npeople at all stages of life to live, work, learn, shop, and play in close proximity.\nPlanning for compact, mixed-use communities helps to reduce infrastructure and\nservice duplication costs, preserves rural lands, encourages social interaction and\na greater sense of community, supports alternative transportation modes, and\nreduces travel needs and commuting times.\n(5) A high standard of urban design supports a memorable, attractive, and livable city.\nTo achieve this, policies of this Plan define key urban design elements to be\napplied generally across the City and more specifically within the Uptown Waterloo\nUrban Growth Centre and other designated Nodes and Corridors.\nNetworks and Transportation\n(6) Active forms of transportation provide alternatives to the automobile and this Plan\nplaces a high priority on encouraging active transportation. Objectives and policies\nin this Plan recognize the strong relationship between transportation and land use\n10\n\nby planning for a transportation network that supports designated Nodes and\nCorridors and their planned intensification, thereby providing people with the\nopportunity to live closer to where they work, learn, shop and play.\n(7) It is desirable to plan for and support a shift in focus from providing roads to move\ncars, to providing streets where people can interact and travel on, whether by foot,\nbicycle, transit or other motorized vehicle. Roads under the City\u2019s jurisdiction will\nbe planned to serve as a network of complete streets, facilitating the movement of,\nand interaction between, all travel modes \u2013 pedestrians, bicycles, transit and\nmotorized vehicles \u2013 within and throughout the City. The complete streets concept\nrecognizes that the streets within the road network provide meeting places for\nsocial and business interaction and as such, need to provide access for a full range\nof citizens within the community.\n(8) The City will support and contribute to the success of the public transit system.\nPolicies in this Plan address the application of Transit-Oriented Development\nprinciples, integrating transit with other travel modes and supporting rapid transit.\n(9) Bicycle and vehicular parking are an integral component of the City\u2019s transportation\nsystem. Policies outline the City\u2019s expectations regarding the design and\ndevelopment of future parking areas to meet community needs and seek to ensure\nthat parking areas balance the needs of motorists with the needs of users of active\ntravel modes such as walking, or cycling.\n(10) The City will plan for the extension or expansion of existing services to ensure\ncontiguous growth, minimize the under-utilization of municipal services and to\nsupport the achievement of minimum intensification targets within the Built-up\nArea. Where it is determined that adequate municipal water, sanitary or storm\nsewer capacity does not exist to support proposed development, the City shall not\nbe obligated to provide such services in advance of available budget resources.\n(11) The City will plan for trails and open space networks and supporting facilities that\nare interconnected and serve transportation, recreation and leisure, and\nenvironmental functions.\nArts, Culture, Heritage, Recreation and Leisure\n(12) Healthy social and cultural systems contribute to a healthy, sustainable and\neconomically vibrant community. This Plan also recognizes the importance of\nplanning for the provision of a wide range of arts, culture, heritage, recreation and\n11\n\nleisure facilities, programs and services to meet the needs and contribute to the\nfuture quality of life of the community.\n(13) The City will plan to maximize the use of existing facilities and community\nresources in the provision of arts, culture, heritage, recreation and leisure facilities,\nservices and programs.\n(14) In acknowledgment of the expanded powers and responsibilities provided to\nmunicipalities by the Province of Ontario, the conservation of cultural heritage\nresources is required. The Heritage policies of this Plan provide a detailed\nframework for conservation of the City\u2019s cultural heritage resources.\nEconomy\n(15) A strong, diverse economy is a pillar for a healthy, sustainable community. Policies\nrecognize that Waterloo\u2019s economy is transitioning from one based on\nmanufacturing and industrial activity to a more post- industrial economy with a\ngreater focus on technology and knowledge industries and institutions. Further,\nthis Plan contains policies that recognize Waterloo\u2019s diverse economy and protect\nWaterloo\u2019s employment areas from conversion to non-employment uses.\n(16) Creative, sustainable cities are supported by strong and interconnected social,\ncultural, economic and environmental systems. This Plan seeks to strengthen\nrelationships between these systems, and recognizes that creative, sustainable\ncities will be competitive in the knowledge economy. This Plan recognizes that the\nCity will play an active role in ensuring that Waterloo displays characteristics of a\ncreative and sustainable city.\n(17) The City will play an important role in planning for and supporting efficient land use\npatterns that support a strong, sustainable economy.\n(18) The City will plan to support the growth and development of a well- educated\nworkforce. Policies place a continued emphasis on collaboration and sharing of\ninformation and ideas between business, government and non-government\norganizations on issues of shared interest, including economic issues.\n(19) Research, academic, and other learning institutions are an important element of\nWaterloo\u2019s economy. Policies provide support for growth in research institutions\nand think tank clusters and recognize the planned growth of the three post-\nsecondary educational institutions. The role of libraries is recognized in terms of\nfacilitating access to information and lifelong learning opportunities.\n12",

    "snippet": "187\n\nCHAPTER 10 LAND USE POLICIES\nOverview\nThe land use policies set out in this chapter build upon the framework provided in previous\nchapters of this Plan. They are intended to be comprehensive policy statements\npertaining to the land use designations as shown on the Schedule \u2018A\u2019 - Land Use Plan,\nSchedule \u2018A1\u2019 \u2013 Commercial Land Uses, Schedule \u2018A2\u2019 \u2013 Employment Areas,\nSchedule \u2018A3\u2019 \u2013 Open Space Land Uses and Schedule \u2018A4\u2019 \u2013 Natural System. It is\nthe intent of this Plan that urban growth in the City will occur in accordance with the land\nuse designations as shown on the above-mentioned Schedules and as set out in the\npolicy sections of this chapter.\nThis Plan includes five categories of land use designations \u2013 Residential, Commercial,\nEmployment, Open Space and Major Institutional. With the exception of the Major\nInstitutional designation, each designation includes a sub- set of designations that further\ndefine the intended planned function of lands included within the designation. The policies\nrelated to each land use designation establish the uses that are contemplated in each\ndesignation. Together, the designations describe where uses such as housing,\nemployment, stores, services, open space, institutions and recreation are contemplated\nto locate and where a mix of uses is desired or required.\nThis Plan contemplates a greater mixing of uses on individual sites than has been planned\nhistorically within Waterloo. This is particularly the case for lands within Residential and\nCommercial designations within Nodes and Corridors. Specifically, categories within\nResidential and Commercial designation speak to maintaining a primarily residential or\ncommercial function while defining a mix of supporting uses that provide opportunities for\npeople to live, work, learn and play in close proximity. Supporting uses may be permitted\nto be developed as a freestanding use on a site, or as ancillary uses which are intended\nto be secondary uses on a site and required to be located within a mixed-use building or\non a mixed-use site. Opportunities for a mixing of uses on sites designated Employment\nare more limited. In order to support the objective of ensuring a long term supply of\nemployment lands, Employment designations contemplate a range of employment uses\nand limit other supporting uses to varying degrees, as defined within the individual land\nuse designations.\n10.1 RESIDENTIAL LAND USE POLICIES\nVision\nThe City will plan for a full range of residential neighbourhoods that meet the needs of the\nCity\u2019s residents. The City\u2019s residential neighbourhoods vary significantly in their planned\n188\n\nfunction, context, and intensity of land use. The residential land use designations of this\nPlan provide opportunities for a range of housing forms and densities, from lower density\nneighbourhoods, to high density neighbourhoods that permit high-rise apartment units.\nThe residential land use designations are designed to provide for a range of housing\nforms and densities.\nThe residential categories allow ancillary uses, with higher density residential categories\npermitting a broader range of ancillary uses. The intent of this structure is that higher\ndensity residential projects have the ability to incorporate an appropriate range of non-\nresidential uses, thereby facilitating mixed-use development and increasing densities.\nThe non-residential ancillary uses support the complete community concept by providing\nconvenient local access to day to day goods and services.\nMedium to high density residential land uses are generally directed to designated Nodes\nand Corridors. The Nodes and Corridors are planned to have convenient access to transit,\nbe pedestrian supportive through design, and are anticipated to accommodate a\nsignificant portion of Waterloo\u2019s growth to 2031.\nThis Plan contemplates the conservation of low-density neighbourhoods outside of\ndesignated Nodes and Corridors, with limited change to the existing residential character\nof such neighbourhoods. These areas are designated Low Density Residential in this\nPlan. Intensification within low-density neighbourhoods is restricted by policies that are\nintended to maintain the character and land use intensity of such neighbourhoods.\nAll residential development will be consistent with the City\u2019s urban design objectives and\npolicies as set out in this Plan and supporting implementation documents.\n10.1.1 General Policies\n(1) Lands designated residential are shown on Schedule \u2018A\u2019 - Land Use Plan.\nResidential land use designations serve a range of functions as described in the\npolicies of this chapter. The residential land use designations are:\n(a) Low Density Residential.\n(b) Mixed-Use Medium Density Residential.\n(c) Mixed-Use Medium High Density Residential.\n(d) Mixed-Use High Density Residential.\n(2) Approval of development within areas designated Low Density Residential, Mixed-\nUse Medium Density Residential, Mixed-Use Medium High Density Residential,\nand Mixed-Use High Density Residential as shown on Schedule \u2018A\u2019 - Land Use\nPlan will be subject to the availability of schools, parks and recreation facilities,\ninfrastructure, and all other services and public works required to service the\n189\n\nproposed development to the standards of the City and authorities having\njurisdiction.\n(3) The City shall use various tools and processes at its disposal to implement the\nresidential land use policies of this Plan, including but not necessarily limited to\nzoning, site plan control, determination of complete development applications,\nexcluding site plan applications, and property standards.\n(4) Any residential development proposed in close proximity to a rail line shall be\nsubject to the noise policies, set out in the Environment and Energy Chapter.\nHome Occupations\n(5) Home occupations may be permitted in land use designations that permit\nresidential uses, as set out in the implementing Zoning By-Law. Where a class or\nclasses of home occupations are not permitted in the Zoning By- Law, a Zoning\nBy-Law Amendment shall be required, and shall demonstrate that:\n(a) The home occupation is compatible with adjacent residential uses with respect\nto built form, noise, odour, fumes, vibration, dust, glare, traffic, and parking;\n(b) There is no outside storage of goods associated with the home occupation;\n(c) The home occupation will not generate a significant increase in vehicular\ntraffic;\n(d) No exterior alterations are to be made to the dwelling other than those made\nto enhance the residential use of the structure;\n(e) There are no proposed outside storage and display areas, and exterior lighting\nand signage is restricted to avoid impacting adjacent land uses;\n(f) The home occupation fulfills the requirements governing such matters as\npermitted uses, allowable floor space, parking and signage as may be provided\nfor in the Zoning By-Law and the Sign By-law; and,\n(g) No significant delivery or shipment of goods or materials to or from the dwelling\nis required by the home occupation;\nHigh Quality and Innovative Design\n(6) The City encourages innovation in the design of residential areas and in the design\nand construction of residential units, where such innovation will:\n(a) Incorporate sustainable design;\n(b) Lower costs to purchasers;\n(c) Maintain compatibility with surrounding land uses and complement the existing\ncharacter of the surrounding neighbourhood;\n(d) Reduce municipal expenditure;\n190\n\n(e) Support Waterloo\u2019s development as a complete community; and,\n(f) Protect natural features and their ecological functions.\nResidential Density\n(7) In order to plan for the availability of medium density, medium high density and\nhigh density housing sites, and to assist in the achievement of the planned\ndensities for a given area, the Zoning By-Law will incorporate performance\nstandards intended to minimize the re- subdivision of sites intended for multiple\nunit housing forms to lower density housing and the subsequent under-\ndevelopment of sites.\n(8) Council recognizes the importance of achieving sufficient minimum levels\nDeferral\nof density in Designated Greenfield Areas to economically provide\nNo. 8\nmunicipal services and contribute toward the achievement of Designated\nGreenfield Area density targets set out in Policy 3.5(2) of this Plan.\n(9) Densities referred to within specific residential land use designations\nshall be interpreted as net density calculations. All portions of the site that\nare designated Residential shall be used to calculate adherence to such\nnet density regulations, provided further that:\nDeferral\n(a) Development within Designated Greenfield Areas shall also adhere\nNo. 9\nto minimum gross density targets set out in policy 3.5(2) of this Plan.\n(b) To implement policy 3.5.(2)(a) of this Plan, the City will apply\nminimum density requirements, through appropriate planning\nmechanisms, to all residential Designated Greenfield Areas that are\nsubject to a Plan of Subdivision after January 1, 2011.\n(10) This Plan is intended to guide development in terms of character, scale and\nintensity of use and built form.

They are intended to be comprehensive policy statements\npertaining to the land use designations as shown on the Schedule \u2018A\u2019 - Land Use Plan,\nSchedule \u2018A1\u2019 \u2013 Commercial Land Uses, Schedule \u2018A2\u2019 \u2013 Employment Areas,\nSchedule \u2018A3\u2019 \u2013 Open Space Land Uses and Schedule \u2018A4\u2019 \u2013 Natural System. It is\nthe intent of this Plan that urban growth in the City will occur in accordance with the land\nuse designations as shown on the above-mentioned Schedules and as set out in the\npolicy sections of this chapter.\nThis Plan includes five categories of land use designations \u2013 Residential, Commercial,\nEmployment, Open Space and Major Institutional. With the exception of the Major\nInstitutional designation, each designation includes a sub- set of designations that further\ndefine the intended planned function of lands included within the designation. The policies\nrelated to each land use designation establish the uses that are contemplated in each\ndesignation. Together, the designations describe where uses such as housing,\nemployment, stores, services, open space, institutions and recreation are contemplated\nto locate and where a mix of uses is desired or required.\nThis Plan contemplates a greater mixing of uses on individual sites than has been planned\nhistorically within Waterloo. This is particularly the case for lands within Residential and\nCommercial designations within Nodes and Corridors. Specifically, categories within\nResidential and Commercial designation speak to maintaining a primarily residential or\ncommercial function while defining a mix of supporting uses that provide opportunities for\npeople to live, work, learn and play in close proximity. Supporting uses may be permitted\nto be developed as a freestanding use on a site, or as ancillary uses which are intended\nto be secondary uses on a site and required to be located within a mixed-use building or\non a mixed-use site. Opportunities for a mixing of uses on sites designated Employment\nare more limited. In order to support the objective of ensuring a long term supply of\nemployment lands, Employment designations contemplate a range of employment uses\nand limit other supporting uses to varying degrees, as defined within the individual land\nuse designations.\n10.1 RESIDENTIAL LAND USE POLICIES\nVision\nThe City will plan for a full range of residential neighbourhoods that meet the needs of the\nCity\u2019s residents. The City\u2019s residential neighbourhoods vary significantly in their planned\n188\n\nfunction, context, and intensity of land use. The residential land use designations of this\nPlan provide opportunities for a range of housing forms and densities, from lower density\nneighbourhoods, to high density neighbourhoods that permit high-rise apartment units.\nThe residential land use designations are designed to provide for a range of housing\nforms and densities.\nThe residential categories allow ancillary uses, with higher density residential categories\npermitting a broader range of ancillary uses. The intent of this structure is that higher\ndensity residential projects have the ability to incorporate an appropriate range of non-\nresidential uses, thereby facilitating mixed-use development and increasing densities.\nThe non-residential ancillary uses support the complete community concept by providing\nconvenient local access to day to day goods and services.\nMedium to high density residential land uses are generally directed to designated Nodes\nand Corridors. The Nodes and Corridors are planned to have convenient access to transit,\nbe pedestrian supportive through design, and are anticipated to accommodate a\nsignificant portion of Waterloo\u2019s growth to 2031.\nThis Plan contemplates the conservation of low-density neighbourhoods outside of\ndesignated Nodes and Corridors, with limited change to the existing residential character\nof such neighbourhoods. These areas are designated Low Density Residential in this\nPlan. Intensification within low-density neighbourhoods is restricted by policies that are\nintended to maintain the character and land use intensity of such neighbourhoods.\nAll residential development will be consistent with the City\u2019s urban design objectives and\npolicies as set out in this Plan and supporting implementation documents.\n10.1.1 General Policies\n(1) Lands designated residential are shown on Schedule \u2018A\u2019 - Land Use Plan.\nResidential land use designations serve a range of functions as described in the\npolicies of this chapter. The residential land use designations are:\n(a) Low Density Residential.\n(b) Mixed-Use Medium Density Residential.\n(c) Mixed-Use Medium High Density Residential.\n(d) Mixed-Use High Density Residential.\n(2) Approval of development within areas designated Low Density Residential, Mixed-\nUse Medium Density Residential, Mixed-Use Medium High Density Residential,\nand Mixed-Use High Density Residential as shown on Schedule \u2018A\u2019 - Land Use\nPlan will be subject to the availability of schools, parks and recreation facilities,\ninfrastructure, and all other services and public works required to service the\n189\n\nproposed development to the standards of the City and authorities having\njurisdiction.\n(3) The City shall use various tools and processes at its disposal to implement the\nresidential land use policies of this Plan, including but not necessarily limited to\nzoning, site plan control, determination of complete development applications,\nexcluding site plan applications, and property standards.\n(4) Any residential development proposed in close proximity to a rail line shall be\nsubject to the noise policies, set out in the Environment and Energy Chapter.\nHome Occupations\n(5) Home occupations may be permitted in land use designations that permit\nresidential uses, as set out in the implementing Zoning By-Law. Where a class or\nclasses of home occupations are not permitted in the Zoning By- Law, a Zoning\nBy-Law Amendment shall be required, and shall demonstrate that:\n(a) The home occupation is compatible with adjacent residential uses with respect\nto built form, noise, odour, fumes, vibration, dust, glare, traffic, and parking;\n(b) There is no outside storage of goods associated with the home occupation;\n(c) The home occupation will not generate a significant increase in vehicular\ntraffic;\n(d) No exterior alterations are to be made to the dwelling other than those made\nto enhance the residential use of the structure;\n(e) There are no proposed outside storage and display areas, and exterior lighting\nand signage is restricted to avoid impacting adjacent land uses;\n(f) The home occupation fulfills the requirements governing such matters as\npermitted uses, allowable floor space, parking and signage as may be provided\nfor in the Zoning By-Law and the Sign By-law; and,\n(g) No significant delivery or shipment of goods or materials to or from the dwelling\nis required by the home occupation;\nHigh Quality and Innovative Design\n(6) The City encourages innovation in the design of residential areas and in the design\nand construction of residential units, where such innovation will:\n(a) Incorporate sustainable design;\n(b) Lower costs to purchasers;\n(c) Maintain compatibility with surrounding land uses and complement the existing\ncharacter of the surrounding neighbourhood;\n(d) Reduce municipal expenditure;\n190\n\n(e) Support Waterloo\u2019s development as a complete community; and,\n(f) Protect natural features and their ecological functions.\nResidential Density\n(7) In order to plan for the availability of medium density, medium high density and\nhigh density housing sites, and to assist in the achievement of the planned\ndensities for a given area, the Zoning By-Law will incorporate performance\nstandards intended to minimize the re- subdivision of sites intended for multiple\nunit housing forms to lower density housing and the subsequent under-\ndevelopment of sites.\n(8) Council recognizes the importance of achieving sufficient minimum levels\nDeferral\nof density in Designated Greenfield Areas to economically provide\nNo. 8\nmunicipal services and contribute toward the achievement of Designated\nGreenfield Area density targets set out in Policy 3.5(2) of this Plan.\n(9) Densities referred to within specific residential land use designations\nshall be interpreted as net density calculations. All portions of the site that\nare designated Residential shall be used to calculate adherence to such\nnet density regulations, provided further that:\nDeferral\n(a) Development within Designated Greenfield Areas shall also adhere\nNo. 9\nto minimum gross density targets set out in policy 3.5(2) of this Plan.\n(b) To implement policy 3.5.(2)(a) of this Plan, the City will apply\nminimum density requirements, through appropriate planning\nmechanisms, to all residential Designated Greenfield Areas that are\nsubject to a Plan of Subdivision after January 1, 2011.\n(10) This Plan is intended to guide development in terms of character, scale and\nintensity of use and built form. In addition, this Plan provides a framework for the\nCity to plan for infrastructure requirements over the long-term, ensure properties\ndevelop at appropriate densities for the property size, and foster land use\ncompatibility. To achieve the foregoing, density calculations for any residential use\nshall be measured using a net density calculation of bedrooms per hectare. The\nCity will prepare a guideline document outlining how the bedrooms per hectare\ndensity methodology will be used to monitor and implement the density targets of\nthis Plan for the Uptown Waterloo Urban Growth Centre and the Designated\nGreenfield Areas.\n191\n\n(11) Detailed residential densities may be reflected through District Planning, and\nfurther defined in the Zoning By-Law, provided the densities are in conformity with\nthe policies of this Plan.\n(12) Development applications proposing to redesignate lands to the Mixed- Use\nMe"

All designs must be completed in accordance with applicable provincial standards, guidelines, codes, municipal specifications, policies, by-laws, engineering best management practices, and all applicable legislation. The CELM is not intended to be a complete reference for detailed design. Any questions about these requirements should be referred to City staff at the early stages of the design process.\n\n* * *\n\n### [](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-5-underground-servicing-grading-and-utilities.aspx)2.0 DGSSMS\n\nThe Region of Waterloo, in conjunction with area municipalities, has prepared the [DGSSMS](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/doing-business/Construction-Design-Standards-and-Guidelines.aspx#Construction-standards \"Open new window to view DGSSMS\") to create a common set of design guidelines and contract specifications for servicing works within the Municipal Right of Way within the region. The City of Waterloo endorses these standards and design works within the City must conform to them. The DGSSMS take precedence over the related OPS documents, and they are to be used in conjunction with the City\u2019s design standards as outlined in this manual.\n\nExceptions to the DGSSMS that are specific to the City of Waterloo are indicated in the DGSSMS where the exceptions apply. It is the Developer Representative\u2019s and/or the Project Consultant\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the most recent version of the DGSSMS is used.\n\n* * *\n\n### [](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-5-underground-servicing-grading-and-utilities.aspx)3.0 Third-party approvals\n\nIt is the responsibility of the project engineer to determine the required third-party approvals. [Refer to Volume 1 for a list of potential third-party agencies to check for approvals.](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-1.aspx#Approval-from-outside-agencies \"View Volume 1 - Approval from outside agencies\")\n\nUnder the Province of Ontario\u2019s Municipal Drinking Water Licensing Program, a Form 1 \u2013 Record of Waterman\u2019s authorized as a Future Alteration must be completed and approved by the City of Waterloo prior to making watermain alterations to the City\u2019s drinking water distribution system.\n\nUnder the Province of Ontario\u2019s new Consolidated Linear Infrastructure - Environmental Compliance Approval (CLI-ECA) program, stormwater and sanitary system alteration applications must be completed and approved by the City of Waterloo prior to making alterations to the City\u2019s stormwater and/or sanitary collection systems.\n\nFor the purposes of the CLI-ECA submissions, the Owner\u2019s Representative is the Director of City Utilities\n\nDirection and resources for all water utilities alterations are available on the [water utilities alterations page on the City of Waterloo\u2019s website](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/water-utilities-alterations.aspx \"View our Municipal system alterations page\").\n\n* * *\n\n### [](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-5-underground-servicing-grading-and-utilities.aspx)4.0 General servicing\n\n1.   The City of Waterloo does not guarantee that sufficient servicing capacity is available in existing infrastructure for new developments. Servicing capacity should be verified by the Developer\u2019s Representative.\n    1.   For sanitary flows the City can, for a fee, run a scenario on the City\u2019s PCSWMM model and confirm the downstream capacity of the existing flow conditions. If preferred the Developer\u2019s representative can use an approved method to calculate or model the existing downstream infrastructure to confirm there is adequate capacity available. It should be noted that the City\u2019s PCSWMM model is not an all pipes model and the Developer\u2019s representative may still be required to review and confirm capacity within some of the local sewers.\n    2.   For storm flows the Developer\u2019s representative is required to use an approved method to calculate or model the existing downstream infrastructure to confirm there is adequate capacity available.\n\n2.   Existing site conditions must be field verified to confirm the location of services available to the property (including pipe invert elevations, MH, valves and other infrastructure) prior to undertaking the engineering design for the project. The City does not guarantee the accuracy of the information presented on any drawings that are obtained from the City or other parties for design purposes.\n3.   The contractor shall ensure locates are completed prior to construction\n4.   Proof of locates from Hydro One, Enova Power Corp., Enbridge, Cable, Bell, other telecommunications companies if applicable, City of Waterloo and Regional Traffic shall be produced for Engineering Services and/or City Utilities Staff upon request\n5.   Site services must not be extended, expanded or connected to other lands without prior written approval of the City\n6.   Show a minimum of one (1) meter clearance from building foundations for all services\n7.   All internal connections and separation of services shall meet minimum MECP requirements\n8.   Provide insulation of services where minimum depth of cover as per DGSSMS cannot be achieved, and indicate insulation details\n\n#### 4.1 Site plan\n\n1.   For residential/condominium townhouse developments, in order to comply with the OBC, individual sanitary, storm, and water services must be provided to each unit. In the case of stacked townhouse developments, provide individual sanitary, storm and water services for each set of stacked units.\n\n#### 4.2 Extending municipal infrastructure to service a development\n\nWhen new Municipal Services need to be extended to service new developments, a special servicing agreement would be required including plan and profile design drawings, a cost is applied with the agreement, and a performance security. These securities would be separate from the required site plan securities. [Refer to the Fees and Charges By-law for further details.](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/bylaw-directory.aspx#F \"View our By-law directory page\")\n\n#### [](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-5-underground-servicing-grading-and-utilities.aspx)4.3 Disconnecting existing services\n\n1.   Existing sanitary services must be disconnected at the main. If the existing service is not PVC, a section of PVC pipe is to be connected to the existing pipe with a flexible coupling. The downstream end of the abandoned service shall be capped with a gasketed PVC cap. The upstream side of the abandoned service shall be plugged with grout or lean-mix concrete.\n2.   Existing water service 50 mm or less in dia. shall be abandoned at the main. If the main stop is found to be leaking at the time of abandonment it must be removed in its entirety.\n3.   Existing water service 100 mm or larger in dia. shall be disconnected at the mechanical joint connection at the watermain.

All designs must be completed in accordance with applicable provincial standards, guidelines, codes, municipal specifications, policies, by-laws, engineering best management practices, and all applicable legislation. The CELM is not intended to be a complete reference for detailed design. Any questions about these requirements should be referred to City staff at the early stages of the design process.\n\n* * *\n\n### [](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-5-underground-servicing-grading-and-utilities.aspx)2.0 DGSSMS\n\nThe Region of Waterloo, in conjunction with area municipalities, has prepared the [DGSSMS](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/doing-business/Construction-Design-Standards-and-Guidelines.aspx#Construction-standards \"Open new window to view DGSSMS\") to create a common set of design guidelines and contract specifications for servicing works within the Municipal Right of Way within the region. The City of Waterloo endorses these standards and design works within the City must conform to them. The DGSSMS take precedence over the related OPS documents, and they are to be used in conjunction with the City\u2019s design standards as outlined in this manual.\n\nExceptions to the DGSSMS that are specific to the City of Waterloo are indicated in the DGSSMS where the exceptions apply. It is the Developer Representative\u2019s and/or the Project Consultant\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the most recent version of the DGSSMS is used.\n\n* * *\n\n### [](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-5-underground-servicing-grading-and-utilities.aspx)3.0 Third-party approvals\n\nIt is the responsibility of the project engineer to determine the required third-party approvals. [Refer to Volume 1 for a list of potential third-party agencies to check for approvals.](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-1.aspx#Approval-from-outside-agencies \"View Volume 1 - Approval from outside agencies\")\n\nUnder the Province of Ontario\u2019s Municipal Drinking Water Licensing Program, a Form 1 \u2013 Record of Waterman\u2019s authorized as a Future Alteration must be completed and approved by the City of Waterloo prior to making watermain alterations to the City\u2019s drinking water distribution system.\n\nUnder the Province of Ontario\u2019s new Consolidated Linear Infrastructure - Environmental Compliance Approval (CLI-ECA) program, stormwater and sanitary system alteration applications must be completed and approved by the City of Waterloo prior to making alterations to the City\u2019s stormwater and/or sanitary collection systems.\n\nFor the purposes of the CLI-ECA submissions, the Owner\u2019s Representative is the Director of City Utilities\n\nDirection and resources for all water utilities alterations are available on the [water utilities alterations page on the City of Waterloo\u2019s website](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/water-utilities-alterations.aspx \"View our Municipal system alterations page\").\n\n* * *\n\n### [](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-5-underground-servicing-grading-and-utilities.aspx)4.0 General servicing\n\n1.   The City of Waterloo does not guarantee that sufficient servicing capacity is available in existing infrastructure for new developments. Servicing capacity should be verified by the Developer\u2019s Representative.\n    1.   For sanitary flows the City can, for a fee, run a scenario on the City\u2019s PCSWMM model and confirm the downstream capacity of the existing flow conditions. If preferred the Developer\u2019s representative can use an approved method to calculate or model the existing downstream infrastructure to confirm there is adequate capacity available. It should be noted that the City\u2019s PCSWMM model is not an all pipes model and the Developer\u2019s representative may still be required to review and confirm capacity within some of the local sewers.\n    2.   For storm flows the Developer\u2019s representative is required to use an approved method to calculate or model the existing downstream infrastructure to confirm there is adequate capacity available.\n\n2.   Existing site conditions must be field verified to confirm the location of services available to the property (including pipe invert elevations, MH, valves and other infrastructure) prior to undertaking the engineering design for the project. The City does not guarantee the accuracy of the information presented on any drawings that are obtained from the City or other parties for design purposes.\n3.   The contractor shall ensure locates are completed prior to construction\n4.   Proof of locates from Hydro One, Enova Power Corp., Enbridge, Cable, Bell, other telecommunications companies if applicable, City of Waterloo and Regional Traffic shall be produced for Engineering Services and/or City Utilities Staff upon request\n5.   Site services must not be extended, expanded or connected to other lands without prior written approval of the City\n6.   Show a minimum of one (1) meter clearance from building foundations for all services\n7.   All internal connections and separation of services shall meet minimum MECP requirements\n8.   Provide insulation of services where minimum depth of cover as per DGSSMS cannot be achieved, and indicate insulation details\n\n#### 4.1 Site plan\n\n1.   For residential/condominium townhouse developments, in order to comply with the OBC, individual sanitary, storm, and water services must be provided to each unit. In the case of stacked townhouse developments, provide individual sanitary, storm and water services for each set of stacked units.\n\n#### 4.2 Extending municipal infrastructure to service a development\n\nWhen new Municipal Services need to be extended to service new developments, a special servicing agreement would be required including plan and profile design drawings, a cost is applied with the agreement, and a performance security. These securities would be separate from the required site plan securities. [Refer to the Fees and Charges By-law for further details.](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/bylaw-directory.aspx#F \"View our By-law directory page\")\n\n#### [](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/volume-5-underground-servicing-grading-and-utilities.aspx)4.3 Disconnecting existing services\n\n1.   Existing sanitary services must be disconnected at the main. If the existing service is not PVC, a section of PVC pipe is to be connected to the existing pipe with a flexible coupling. The downstream end of the abandoned service shall be capped with a gasketed PVC cap. The upstream side of the abandoned service shall be plugged with grout or lean-mix concrete.\n2.   Existing water service 50 mm or less in dia. shall be abandoned at the main. If the main stop is found to be leaking at the time of abandonment it must be removed in its entirety.\n3.   Existing water service 100 mm or larger in dia. shall be disconnected at the mechanical joint connection at the watermain. The mechanical joint connection shall be completely removed from the main and any service pipe left in the ground shall be filled with grout to prevent sinkholes\n4.   Tapping sleeve and valves shall be cut out of the watermain and the watermain shall be reinstated with a straight pipe and approved fittings. If the service terminates at the watermain with a mechanical joint (MJ) the service can be disconnected from the tee and a MJ plug placed on the tee. All cut or disconnected pipes must be capped or bulkheaded\n5.   For residential service abandonments, the Building Department shall be informed of all disconnections and shall be on site to complete an inspection during the disconnections. Residential sanitary and water services are to be capped at property line until the development takes place. At that time"
